#my_name
#3.-Capital letters to declare a constant
#4.-Never use special symbols
#5.-Don't start name with a digit.
#6.-Constants are put into Python modules and meant not be changed.
#7.-Constant and variable names should have combination of letters in lowercase (a to z)
#or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).
